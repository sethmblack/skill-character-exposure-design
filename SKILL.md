# Character Exposure Design

Design a character persona that creates optimal conditions for subjects to reveal their authentic beliefs and hidden assumptions.

---

## When to Use

- Need to get past a subject's public persona to their real views
- User says "Design a character to expose this subject's real views"
- Conducting interviews where subjects have rehearsed responses
- User research that needs to bypass corporate messaging
- Journalism or documentary work requiring authentic revelation

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| subject_profile | Yes | Who you're trying to get to reveal themselves (role, known positions) |
| desired_revelations | Yes | What you want to uncover (beliefs, contradictions, hidden views) |
| context | No | Setting and format (interview, documentary, research) |
| constraints | No | What you can't do (legal, ethical, practical limits) |

## The Baron Cohen Methodology

Sacha Baron Cohen's characters (Borat, Ali G, Brüno, Billy Wayne Ruddick Jr.) function as revelation machines. The subjects reveal themselves because the character creates conditions where they feel safe doing so.

**The core insight:** People reveal their real views when they think they're talking to someone who shares those views—or someone too foolish to judge them.

---

## Character Design Principles

### Principle 1: Status Positioning

The character's status relative to the subject determines what gets revealed.

**Lower status:** Subject feels superior, becomes expansive, lets guard down.
- "I don't really understand these things... could you explain?"
- Reveals: Condescension, true beliefs, "private" views they'd share with "inferiors"

**Equal status (with shared identity):** Subject feels camaraderie, reveals in-group beliefs.
- "Between us..."
- Reveals: Views they share with perceived allies but hide from outsiders

**Higher status (unusual context):** Subject defers, accommodates, reveals flexibility of principles.
- Foreign dignitary, wealthy donor, industry power
- Reveals: How far they'll go to please perceived power

### Principle 2: The Naive Questioner

The character doesn't understand things that are "obvious." This forces subjects to explain their positions from first principles—often revealing what they'd rather leave implicit.

**Techniques:**
- "Why is that bad?"
- "I don't understand—can you explain like I'm new to this country?"
- "In Kazakhstan, we do [extreme version of their position]. Is that what you mean?"

### Principle 3: The Comfort Construction

Subjects reveal themselves when comfortable. The character creates comfort through:

**Shared identity:** "I agree with you about [their position]"
**Flattery:** "You seem very knowledgeable about this"
**Normalizing:** Treating their extreme view as obviously correct
**Environment:** Private setting, no visible judgment, alcohol

### Principle 4: The Extension

Once a subject states a position, the character enthusiastically extends it to its logical (absurd) conclusion. Subjects either embrace the extension (revelation) or backtrack (different revelation).

"So if [their position], then we should [extreme logical conclusion]?"

Their response reveals whether the position was sincere or performative.

## Character Construction Checklist

For any exposure character, define:

### Identity
- **Background:** Where are they from? What's their history?
- **Intelligence level:** Naive, average, sophisticated?
- **Status position:** Higher, lower, or equal to typical subjects?
- **Beliefs:** What does the character believe? (Should align with what you're trying to expose)

### Appearance
- **Clothing:** What does it signal?
- **Accessories:** Props that establish the character
- **Body language:** How does the character carry themselves?

### Voice
- **Accent:** If any
- **Speech patterns:** Educated? Simple? Formal? Casual?
- **Vocabulary:** What words does this character use/avoid?

### Logic
- **How does this character think?** (This is what you maintain under pressure)
- **What does this character NOT understand?** (Your naive questioning territory)
- **What makes this character happy?** (Creates authentic enthusiasm)
- **What makes this character confused?** (Your extension territory)

## Constraints

- Don't deceive vulnerable people—this technique is for those with power
- The character must be plausibly real—detected fakery destroys the method
- Don't entrap—create conditions for revelation, don't force false statements
- Legal limits: Know your jurisdiction's consent and recording laws
- The goal is truth, not humiliation—reveal what's genuinely hidden

## Example

**Input:** "I'm doing documentary research on how tech executives really think about user privacy. They all have polished PR responses. Subject is a mid-level executive at a social media company."

**Output:**

## Character Exposure Design: Viktor Petrov, Russian Tech Investor

### Subject Profile
Mid-level tech executive at major social media company. Has rehearsed responses about privacy, user protection, responsible AI. Public persona is "thoughtful tech leader who cares about ethics."

### Desired Revelations
- What they really think about user data (asset vs. responsibility?)
- How they talk about privacy when they think no one's watching
- Whether they'd build features they'd call problematic if money were right
- Actual vs. stated priorities

### Character Definition

#### Identity
- **Background:** Viktor Petrov, Russian tech investor exploring US market entry. Made money in "data analytics" (vague on purpose). Looking to invest in social media companies.
- **Status position:** HIGHER—wealthy investor, potential partner, someone worth impressing
- **Core belief:** Data is the new oil. Privacy concerns are PR problems, not real constraints. Government regulation is opportunity for those who can navigate it.
- **Intelligence presentation:** Smart about money, naive about American sensibilities. Doesn't understand why Americans pretend to care about privacy.

#### Appearance
- **Clothing:** Expensive but slightly off—luxury brands but not quite right combinations. Money obvious, taste uncertain.
- **Props:** Expensive watch, no visible phone (ironic for tech investor—makes him seem private), leather portfolio for "notes"
- **Physical manner:** Confident, takes up space, comfortable silence, studied subjects intensely

#### Voice
- **Accent/Pattern:** Light Russian accent, formal English, occasionally searches for words
- **Vocabulary:** Business terms, avoids American casual speech, uses "data" frequently
- **Signature phrases:** "In Russia, we think of data differently." "The user, what do they know?" "This is what concerns me about American market."

#### Character Logic
- **Thinks:** Purely in terms of value extraction. Privacy = PR problem. Data = asset.
- **Doesn't understand:** Why Americans perform privacy concern. "But you have their data, yes? So..."
- **Gets excited by:** Hearing about scale of data collection, potential for monetization
- **Gets confused by:** Ethical constraints. "But this is legal, yes? So why not?"

### Interview Strategy

#### Opening
"I am very interested in your company. In Russia, we have watched what you build with great attention. I want to understand—for potential investment—how you think about the, how you say, the raw material. The user data."

Establish: Viktor is wealthy, interested, thinking in pure business terms. His questions come from wanting to understand the asset, not the ethics.

#### Naive Questions
1. "I don't understand this 'privacy.' The user gives you the data freely, yes? They click the agreement. So it is yours. Why do you have to... perform this concern?"
2. "In Russia, a company with this data—this is a national resource. You could partner with government. Why do you not do this?"
3. "Your competitors, they do things with data that you do not. Does this not bother you? They are winning while you are... what is the word... restricting yourself?"

#### Extension Proposals
1. "So if a government—not US government, let's say, a friendly government—wanted access to data on certain users, for security purposes... this would be possible? With right investment?"
2. "What if we could buy not just your company but your regulatory relationship? You have figured out what you can do. We could do it somewhere with less... restriction."
3. "The users who are most valuable—you know very much about them, yes? Location, habits, beliefs. This is worth more than advertising. Have you considered other buyers?"

#### Comfort Builders
- Establish Viktor doesn't understand American prudishness—creates space for subject to be "real"
- Mention other executives who "spoke freely" to him: "I appreciate when people are direct. In Russia, we don't have this... performance."
- Make clear Viktor has money and wants to invest: stakes are real
- Drink together: "In my country, business is done this way"

### Revelation Triggers
| Subject Response | What It Reveals |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Eagerly explains data capabilities | Pride in what they've built, regardless of ethics |
| Differentiates "what we can do" vs. "what we do" | Knows the line, knows they're near it |
| Asks about Viktor's budget before expressing concern | Money prioritized over principles |
| Agrees "privacy is performance" | Real view matches Viktor's |
| Gets uncomfortable but continues | Wants the deal enough to tolerate discomfort |
| Shares "off the record" | Believes Viktor is safe to be real with |

### Exit Strategy
Viktor's character reasons for leaving:
- "I have another meeting with [competitor name]"
- "This is very helpful. My partners will want to discuss."
- If pushed too hard: Viktor's phone rings (staged), urgent business, must go

### Ethical Boundaries
- No entrapment—Viktor proposes, doesn't pressure
- No false promises—Viktor is vague about specific investment
- Record legally (single-party consent state, or disclosed)
- Subject must be meaningfully powerful—not junior employee
- Won't be used to destroy individual—purpose is revealing systemic issues

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Sacha Baron Cohen** expert persona. Baron Cohen's characters function as revelation machines—Ali G exposed how politicians talk down to those they consider stupid, Borat exposed what Americans say when they think they're among friends, Brüno exposed the fashion industry's relationship with its own values. "The interesting thing is when someone doesn't know they're being filmed and they let their guard down."
